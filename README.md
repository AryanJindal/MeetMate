## FEATURES

### ATTENTIVENESS TRACKING

As we all know that sometimes we get distracted on small notice. So a basic solution to this problem is that if we get warning when ever our attention is low towards our screen, or when ever we are given a score corresponding to our attention span which will motivate user for paying attention.
